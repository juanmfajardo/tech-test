# Requirements

We want a Frontend + Backend application that allows you to create, read, update and delete a list of contacts. Each contact will have: First name, Last name, Email, and phone number. All the fields are mandatory and there canâ€™t be two contacts with the same email. You should be able to see the history of edits on those contacts. The contacts will be persisted in the database.

# Solution
### Backend
- Server: Node.js + Express (express-generator)
- Database: MongoDB + Mongoose ODM

### Frontend
- React (create-react-app)
- React-Bootstrap

### Run
```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

# Technical test

## Requirements:

We want a Frontend + Backend application that allows you to create, read, update and delete a list of contacts. Each contact will have: First name, Last name, Email, and phone number. All the fields are mandatory and there canâ€™t be two contacts with the same email. You should be able to see the history of edits on those contacts. The contacts will be persisted in the database.
